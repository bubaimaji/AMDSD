/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_188.wav,i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_189.wav,no it wasnt even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_190.wav,challenging,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_191.wav,um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_192.wav,moved,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_193.wav,uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_194.wav,and um that was a pretty tough decision cause at that point my family had been,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_195.wav,you know within an hours drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_196.wav,um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_199.wav,oh lots of things um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_200.wav,i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_201.wav,the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_202.wav,at the time i was very much into rock climbing,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_203.wav,and theres just a huge outdoor outdoo outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_204.wav,um in my age group and or single that was another factor um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_205.wav,and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_206.wav,so,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_207.wav,yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_208.wav,um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_211.wav,yeah,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_213.wav,uh that was totally unrelated question um sigh,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_214.wav,relatively easily,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_215.wav,it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if im out and i dont get home until eleven thirty then,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_216.wav,you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_217.wav,but generally i can sleep through the night ive had some pretty,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_218.wav,anxietyridden dreams the last couple of weeks um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_219.wav,but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_221.wav,um yeah im sure they are i mean im in another transition state im moving out of,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_222.wav,out of the sigh house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman sigh um,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_227.wav,yeah,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_230.wav,um living with her is pretty hard like its probably the hardest thing ive ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i dont think i wouldve said yes to the situation,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/dev/377_segment_234.wav,um i feel trapped and helpless like theres you know nothing i can,1
