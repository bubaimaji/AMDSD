/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_189.wav,the last time i had a heated debate,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_190.wav,was um i had a heated debate about,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_198.wav,um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_199.wav,they think that like theres some theres some sort of theyll as i understand it they have um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_200.wav,they have a certain uh they think that the,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_201.wav,like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that theres a whole like,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_202.wav,complexity of character within the movie,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_203.wav,and um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_204.wav,that somehow like,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_205.wav,sigh um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_206.wav,what what were they saying they were saying like the movie,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_207.wav,it like xxx its like the end of an era,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_208.wav,which makes it like kinda like casino and theres this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_209.wav,how they interact in the plot,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_210.wav,um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_211.wav,kind of like,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_213.wav,yeah i guess,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_214.wav,i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i its not like a bad movie or anything but its,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_215.wav,the um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_216.wav,i just dont think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful mean meaningful of a character like i,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_217.wav,i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_219.wav,in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_220.wav,um theres nothing bad about the movie theres nothing articulable art like articulable about thats its like solid so good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_221.wav,um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_222.wav,the eh it really rea you know its cool its but,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_223.wav,but its meaningless mea for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_225.wav,and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_226.wav,and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_227.wav,so in the movie django unchained,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_228.wav,um you have django and django is like a kinda hes a two dimensional character but i dont think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_229.wav,the,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_230.wav,big purpose of the movie is,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_232.wav,and um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_233.wav,and you have doctor king schultz whos this uh,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_234.wav,whos this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_235.wav,was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent theres no way he wouldve risked his life to save django,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_236.wav,or like wouldve gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save djangos wife etcetera,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_237.wav,and um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_238.wav,and the reason rea the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldnt but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_239.wav,sacrifice themself for someone else,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_241.wav,um which strikes stri which strikes me as so like,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_242.wav,um,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_243.wav,like who,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/380_segment_244.wav,uh like,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_103.wav,getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog every day and um,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_114.wav,its been quite some time officially,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_115.wav,its probably been,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_116.wav,i dont know exactly but lets see,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_117.wav,maybe more than fifteen years ago,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_123.wav,um because i found a better alternative,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_125.wav,um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_126.wav,and ive tried a variety of um methods,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_127.wav,and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer,1
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/402_segment_128.wav,and um that was really the first person that,1

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_74.wav,when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_75.wav,the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know hes very a macho kinda manly guy i didnt want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_76.wav,and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard,0

/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_80.wav,i can my son comes to mind hes twenty two years old,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_81.wav,and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and its okay im okay with it,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_82.wav,hes used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_83.wav,as opposed to waiting him to call me,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_84.wav,and i think,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_85.wav,it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i wouldve kind of adjusted that so that he wouldnt be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_86.wav,and check on him he doesnt live with me he has his own place,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_87.wav,but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that hes okay i think this is probably way more laughter ethereal than you meant but,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_88.wav,i wouldve i wouldve done that differently i wouldve mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i wouldve treated him more of an adult,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_89.wav,and then also not expected him to just kinda you know,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_90.wav,i wouldve killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_93.wav,woo laughter no its not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_94.wav,i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as theyre okay youre okay so,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_95.wav,it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_96.wav,so,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_97.wav,my parenting has become easier the more and more ive lived in that truth where im not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_98.wav,so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_101.wav,seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldnt make uh it could be as simple as an outfit laughter you know choice or as much as a career change,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_102.wav,but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_103.wav,kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_104.wav,i i didnt wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didnt wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_105.wav,and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily its nothing major with my kids but,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_106.wav,whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_109.wav,its fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so its just its a real,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_110.wav,its an honor that i was able to do it its an honor that theyre healthy,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_111.wav,um and its fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_112.wav,and its like theyre mini mes but then theyre also different than i am and so its fun just,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_113.wav,being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so im enjoying that,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_115.wav,wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_116.wav,so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_117.wav,its just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure,0
/home/suhita/Documents/multimodal/daic/audio/train/449_segment_118.wav,uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling,0
